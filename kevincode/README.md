So basic, my idea is that before you access the table program, it's going to ask you which waiter you want, and according to your answer (which waiter you select), it will limit the tables you can access. So I mainly changed the Main class and, according to your answer, I changed the FXML file as well. I split it into three different FXML files, which represent three different waiters. And since I didn't put color in yet, and this code is actually half-finished, this program might need further improvement, so I just uploaded the code individually.
